# Miscellaneous tools with no specific purpose #

Currently these tools are implemented:
  * **getfile.sh** - get file path using `dmenu`
  * **screenshot.sh** - frontend to `imagemagick`
  * **setbg.sh** - adopt different gui applications colors to some image
  * **share.sh** - choose file using `dmenu` and post it to a `pastebin`-like service
  * **share_selection.sh** - posts current selection contents to a `pastebin`-like service
  
Enjoy them! :)
